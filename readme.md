Advent of code 2022.

Oh, the joy of christmas, and computer software programming!

- Pablo Anttila

Post /day1 and /day2, i've already updgraded to solving puzzles and learning a new language. It might take a bit longer, hoping the puzzle complexity won't grow too steep as the days pass by.

Been working with RUST as of day 2. Seems nice and quick. Would love to have warnings for errors in Vim though.
